            Curious. Generalist. Nerd. No particular order.<br> <br>
            I am passionate about using the technical skills I learn to help others. My main interests are game development, cybersecurity, robotics, and web development. Ask me about the projects I'm working on!<br>
            Before I aspired to a career in software, I studied astrophysics. I enjoyed learning about the mathematics of the universe and the mysteries it uncovers. I also enjoy learning about other topics like animation, music composition, and math. I hope to channel my curiosity and breadth to continue growing in software.<br>
            To wind down, I like playing games and reading. Some of my favorite game fixations are Fire Emblem, Legend of Zelda, and Dungeons & Dragons. Books I'm reading are Queen of Nothing by Holly Black, I'll Give You the Sun by Jandy Nelson, and Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari. Tell me about your favorite books and games!
